# About

The Arrow Library is a simple yet stable and versatile interface to draw arrows on the screen.

-   Creating an arrow has never been easier, all it takes is one function call with some parameters and the library takes care of the rest.
-   Following moving targets requires no effort, the built in tick update mechanism takes care of everything.
-   Don't want to go through the hassle of creating your own arrow sprites? Guess what, we've got you covered.

_While this library is still under development, released versions are tested and stable._

**Roadmap**

-   Spaced tick update when tracking large amounts of arrows
-   Grouping arrows when multiple entities are within the same direction
-   Add min/max distance threshold for drawing arrows
-   Add function to update storage settings after initialization
-   Implement new parameters for existing functions

# How to use

Add `arrowlib` as a required dependency in your _info.json_ and import the arrow class using `local arrow = require("__arrowlib__/arrow")`.

Head over to the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/Subject-314159/arrowlib/wiki) for the complete description how to use this library.
